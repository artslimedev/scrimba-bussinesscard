# Scrimba Solo Business Card Project

This app is the first initial project in the Scrimba React Course. The purpose of this project was for me to review and reinforce the React basics I have learned up until this point during my time at the 100Devs Agency as well as on my own.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, CSS, JSX

In this project I built a React business card using Create-React-App from scratch. That means not using the vscode shortcuts for imports or creating components. I did this to get a better understanding of how imports work both for files like CSS stylesheets, and for exporting and importing custom components. I wrote all the functional components from scratch to better be able to commit the process to memory and not rely on VSCode shortcuts.

## Lessons Learned:

Once I finished this project, I gained a better understanding of how importing and exporting of components worked. I also reinforced my ability to create custom components as well as increased my speed in being able to create and implement them.
